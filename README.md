# Mandelbrot_Set

My own realization of mandelbrot set.
About the functional of the program:
-In the text field you can enter a number of iterations, needed to determine whether the point belongs to mandelbrot set or not.(after entering the number you need to press ENTER)
-You can press on any point of the screen in order to move the "camera"
-Scroll the mouse wheel to zoom in
-Press "s" to see the speed at which the point is "escaping"
