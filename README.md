### Description:
This is my implementation of the mandelbrot set visualization tool.
Here I used the Java programming language and the javafx graphics library. (I know, Java is slow, but at the time of development, that was the only language I knew).
### How to launch:
You can simply download the .jar file and execute it, providing that you have JRE installed.
### How to use the program:
-In the text field you can enter a number of iterations, needed to determine whether the point belongs to mandelbrot set or not.(after entering the number you need to press ENTER)<br />
-You can press on any point of the screen in order to move the "camera"<br />
-Scroll the mouse wheel to zoom in or out<br />
-Press "s" to see the speed at which the point is "escaping"<br />
